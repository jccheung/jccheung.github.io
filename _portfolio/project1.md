Working closely with a graphic designer for the Front End, I designed the website based on graphics and figma file provided to me by the graphic designer. Multiple iterations of the desing of the website was required in order to get the website to look as intended.

Example Form on Live Website

For the backend, utilizing a realtime database to populate and dynamically update the web application, based on a unique identifier to search from the database.

Read and Write directly to/from realtime google firebase

The website would then take the data and display it according to the corresponding unique identifier, dynamically updating and returning a 404 page if the entry was not found in the data base.
