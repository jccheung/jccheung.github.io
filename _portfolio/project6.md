Building a full stack web application from scratch. Using svelte, google realtime firebase and storage as well as html/css bootstrap.

<em>Please note that the screenshots shown are limited to protect IP of the company.</em>

Working closely with a graphic designer for the Front End, I designed the website based on graphics and figma file provided to me by the graphic designer. Multiple iterations of the desing of the website was required in order to get the website to look as intended.


<figure style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/img/portfolio/example_form.png" alt="Figma sketch" width="600" class="noPadding">
<figcaption>
    <em> Example Form on Live Website</em>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For the backend, utilizing a realtime database to populate and dynamically update the web application, based on a unique identifier to search from the database.

<figure style="text-align: center">
<img src="assets/img/portfolio/form_data.png" alt="Google firebase live" width="700" class="noPadding">
<figcaption>
    <em> Read and Write directly to/from realtime google firebase</em>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The website would then take the data and display it according to the corresponding unique identifier, dynamically updating and returning a 404 page if the entry was not found in the data base.
