Ruby jykell file for my personal portfolio website bootstrap theme, the original github repo is from Ravi Riley (https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme) 

The pages have been altered and edited to fit my usage.


This is the Agency Bootstrap theme, converted to a gem-based Jekyll theme with GitHub Pages support.

This is the [Agency Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/agency/), converted to a gem-based Jekyll theme with GitHub Pages support.

While this has been done before, [here](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme), [here](https://github.com/SotiriosVrachas/jekyll-theme-startbootstrap-agency), and [here](https://github.com/laklau/agency-jekyll-theme/), these are outdated and have not been updated or maintained for years. I built this theme from the most recent Bootstrap source.
    

The Jekyll structure of this theme includes:

- `_portfolio` files - what generate the portfolio grid. YAML front matter handles all the details
- the `page` layout allows custom pages, as seen in the legal and 404 pages
- `sitetext.yml` enables complete customization of all site text
- `navigation.yml` enables fully customizable navigation
- `style.yml` enables fully customizable colors, background images, and other style-related things
